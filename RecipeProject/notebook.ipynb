All variables have been validated and necessary changes have been made for better data analysis. Below is the description of all columns along with the steps taken upon them:\n\n**recipe**:\n\nThis column has 947 non-missing and unique values, and no cleaning is needed as it matches the description of having numeric values.\n\n**calories, carbohydrate, sugar, protein**:\n\nThese columns have 895 non-missing values each, with 52 missing values each. These are numeric columns and have been cleaned by grouping the values by category and imputing with the median. This ensures that outliers and larger values do not impact the imputation process, and median imputation is better suited for the data.\n\n**category**:\n\nUpon reviewing the data, it was observed that the column did not match the description provided and required cleaning. The expected number of unique values in the column was around 10, but 11 values were found in the dataset. The anomalous value was identified as \"Chicken Breast\", which was replaced with the appropriate value \"Chicken\" as per the data description.\n\n**servings**:\n\nThis column has 6 values as a string, out of which 4 are numeric in nature and 2 are strings. It has no missing values but is not the same as described in the data information, which stated it was a numeric column. For the two string values \"['4 as a snack','6 as a snack']\", which weren't needed, they were stripped out by checking against the category column that contained the \"Lunch/Snacks\" category. Also, to ensure the entire column has numeric values, the data type was converted to int.\n\n**high_traffic**:\n\nThis column has string values with missing values, same as the description. It was observed that the rows with missing values corresponded to instances where there was no high traffic, and as such, were not labeled. Conversely, those rows with high traffic were appropriately labeled.The NaN values were then removed and named to something of value, such as \"Low\", since the column only had \"High\" as a value.\n\nIn conclusion, the necessary data validation has been performed on this dataset, and the cleaning and transformation have been done accordingly to make the data more usable for analysis.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5e59c62d-fa44-46e2-9ba1-256e5867ebb4"},{"source":"#importing the relevant libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer,LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,cross_val_score,KFold,GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay,classification_report,roc_auc_score,roc_curve,f1_score,accuracy_score,RocCurveDisplay,precision_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier","metadata":{"executionTime":1002,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#importing the relevant libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer,LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,cross_val_score,KFold,GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay,classification_report,roc_auc_score,roc_curve,f1_score,accuracy_score,RocCurveDisplay,precision_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier"},"id":"45554a01-416e-4127-8e3e-53cc0290cb5a","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# importing the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('recipe.csv')","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# importing the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('recipe.csv')"},"cell_type":"code","id":"65109366-9477-45a1-b531-f77c6b08ffbf","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# viewing a sample of the data\ndata.sample(10)","metadata":{"executionTime":492,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# viewing a sample of the data\ndata.sample(10)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"d1451ce8-6649-42cd-9fb1-df0c290802ec","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":3,"data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"recipe","type":"integer"},{"name":"calories","type":"number"},{"name":"carbohydrate","type":"number"},{"name":"sugar","type":"number"},{"name":"protein","type":"number"},{"name":"category","type":"string"},{"name":"servings","type":"string"},{"name":"high_traffic","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":489,"recipe":490,"calories":339.8,"carbohydrate":2.81,"sugar":3.03,"protein":0.24,"category":"Beverages","servings":"4","high_traffic":null},{"index":906,"recipe":907,"calories":194.37,"carbohydrate":12.17,"sugar":1.58,"protein":3.67,"category":"Lunch/Snacks","servings":"4","high_traffic":null},{"index":482,"recipe":483,"calories":920.73,"carbohydrate":9.91,"sugar":38.66,"protein":0.36,"category":"Dessert","servings":"4","high_traffic":"High"},{"index":485,"recipe":486,"calories":139.19,"carbohydrate":20.1,"sugar":18.4,"protein":3.95,"category":"Breakfast","servings":"4","high_traffic":"High"},{"index":400,"recipe":401,"calories":338.71,"carbohydrate":59.94,"sugar":12.26,"protein":30.72,"category":"Breakfast","servings":"4","high_traffic":null},{"index":388,"recipe":389,"calories":null,"carbohydrate":null,"sugar":null,"protein":null,"category":"Lunch/Snacks","servings":"4","high_traffic":"High"},{"index":46,"recipe":47,"calories":69.01,"carbohydrate":39.17,"sugar":39.54,"protein":0.17,"category":"Beverages","servings":"4","high_traffic":null},{"index":289,"recipe":290,"calories":223.01,"carbohydrate":25.99,"sugar":7.52,"protein":11.69,"category":"Meat","servings":"4","high_traffic":"High"},{"index":676,"recipe":677,"calories":261.88,"carbohydrate":0.58,"sugar":12.87,"protein":1.76,"category":"Beverages","servings":"1","high_traffic":null},{"index":613,"recipe":614,"calories":74.47,"carbohydrate":30.82,"sugar":1.86,"protein":4.8,"category":"Breakfast","servings":"2","high_traffic":null}]},"total_rows":10,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"     recipe  calories  carbohydrate  ...      category  servings high_traffic\n489     490    339.80          2.81  ...

Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering\nThis section presents an analysis of a recipe dataset with the objective of identifying patterns or relationships between nutrient variables and website traffic generated by recipes. \n\n**Target Variable**:\nThe dataset's target variable is \"high_traffic\", which is a binary column with two values, \"High\" and \"Low\". The following visualization displays the count of each value. It is evident that the \"High\" value has a higher count than \"Low\", indicating that the majority of the recipes attract high website traffic.\n\n**Recipe Categories**:\nThe visualizations displays the distribution of recipe counts by category, categorized by high and low traffic. The x-axis represents the various recipe categories, while the y-axis indicates the recipe count. The bars are grouped by high and low traffic, distinguished by different colors. It is evident that the Beverages category attracts the least amount of traffic, while Pork, Potato, Vegetables, and Meat categories stand out with high traffic impressions. Additionally, we can observe that Chicken category recipes are the most frequently posted on the website, followed by Breakfast and Beverages.\n\n**Nutrient Variables**:\nPlots were created to analyze the relationship between nutrient variables and the target variable. The scatter plot matrix did not reveal any significant patterns, while the correlation matrix showed little to no correlation. Violinplots and histograms were used to detect data range, outliers, and skewness,which showed the need for scaling or log transformation.We saw that there were outliers but since the dataset was too small,removing outliers should have resulted in loss of valuable information.\n\n**Serving Size**:\nIt was important to analyze the relationship between the servings and the target variable. The first plot shows that recipes serving four people attract the highest traffic, while single serving recipes have the least impressions. The second plot displays the relationship between servings and category, revealing that four is the most targeted serving size across all categories, while other serving sizes have varying levels of popularity.\n\n**Additional Features**:\nThree new attributes have been incorporated in the dataset to enhance the predictive power of the models ,\"healthiness\" that presents the aggregate nutritional value and another that separates recipes into different meal types as \"meal_type\".Another one depicts the High-Low traffic ratio amongst categories.A barplot is presented below, depicting the distribution  with respect to the high_traffic column.The plots shows that if it is a dinner meal type it will  definitely attract high traffic compared to others.On the other hand another plot below shows High-Low Traffic Ratios by category where we can see that Vegetable's category stand out with the highest ratio and which guarantees high traffic.Histogram for healthiness shows that it needs scaling. New features such as meal_type, healthiness and traffic_ratios were created based on the recipe's nutritional profile and categorization. These features were found to have a positive impact on the model's performance, resulting in better scores.Other features were also tested but no improvement in accuracy and other metrics was recorded.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"42066650-50bb-4135-92c7-7476cbd85d81"},{"source":"### Target variable - high_traffic:\nThe target variable for the dataset is  \"high_traffic\" which is based upon two values of \"High\" and \"Low\" which can be described as a binary column.

analysis of a binary classification problem in machine learning, specifically predicting whether website traffic will be high for a particular recipe or not. The goal is to correctly predict high traffic for a recipe more than 80% of the time.\n\nTo achieve this, two models were selected for comparison: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. Logistic Regression was chosen because it is well-suited for binary classification tasks, while Random Forest Classifier was chosen because it is an ensemble algorithm can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, and is easy to interpret.\n\nThe evaluation metric chosen for this problem is Accuracy and F1-Score,however ROC-AUC score will also be used to evaluate the model and select the best one. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while F1-score takes into account both precision and recall to evaluate the model's performance.ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) score is a measure of the overall performance of a classification model. It is a commonly used evaluation metric in binary classification problems.\n\nIn order to prepare our data for machine learning algorithms, we took several steps. First, we dropped the recipe column since it was not relevant for our analysis. Then, we normalized the nutrient variables and other columns to ensure they were on a similar scale. Next, we used one-hot encoding to convert the categorical variables servings, category, meal_type, and high_traffic into numeric format. Finally, we split the data into a training set and a test set using stratification to ensure that the proportion of high-traffic recipes was the same in both sets,plus using statification ensured good results. These steps ensured that our data was ready for use in a machine learning model.\n\nBased on our analysis, it was determined that Logistic Regression performed better than Random Forest Classifier in terms of precision, accuracy, f1_score and roc-auc score. Therefore, we utilized both algorithms for hyperparameter tuning. However, the results of the tuning process did not indicate a significant improvement in precision and accuracy for the Logistic Regression model. The performance of Random Forest Classifier did show improvement, although it remained comparable to that of the Logistic Regression model.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"70ee30b3-eae9-45f6-9488-c6ed06ec06d6"},{"source":"**Preparing the data for modelling**:\n\n- Dropping recipe column\n- Normalizing the nutrient

A suitable KPI to compare model performance to business criteria in this problem could be the precision or positive predictive value (PPV) of the model in predicting high traffic recipes. The PPV is the proportion of true positive predictions (i.e., correctly identifying a high traffic recipe) out of all positive predictions made by the model. A high PPV indicates that the model is effective in identifying recipes that will lead to high traffic, which is important for the business objective of increasing website subscriptions. A PPV of 80% or higher would meet the criteria set by the requester, as they have asked if the team can correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time.\nThe Logistic Regression model outperforms Random Forest Classifier model in the KPI,which suggests that the logistic regression model will suit the business best.\nBy monitoring this KPI,the business can get a more comprehensive

Recommendation\n\nBased on the analysis conducted, it is recommended that the company implement the Logistic Regression model for the website traffic prediction task. This model has shown the best performance in terms of accuracy and precision, with an overall accuracy score of 76% and precision score of 83% while the Random forest just falls behind.Both the models show a precision over 80% but the Logistic Regression leads and thus is more valuable for the business.\n\nTo further improve the model's performance, we recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Data: In order to improve the accuracy and precision of the results, it is recommended that the product manager provide complete data, including recipe name, time to make, and recipe cost, which is readily available on the webpage. Furthermore, to enhance the predictive power of the model, additional data pertaining to customer demographics and purchasing behavior should also be collected. This may include data related to customer age, subscription plan, and viewing history.\n\n2. Deployment: Consider deploying the model on the cloud and use it there for increased convenience and security. However, this would require additional deployment work and cloud expertise. Alternatively, deploying the model as a web service could provide an easier and more accessible option for testing and evaluation.\n\n3. Monitor Performance: We recommend monitoring the performance of the predictive models and updating them regularly as new data becomes available. This will help ensure that the models remain accurate and relevant over time.\n\nIn addition to the KPI mentioned earlier,the business can also monitor the following KPIs:\n\n1. Click-through rate (CTR): This measures the percentage of users who clicked on a recipe after it was displayed on the homepage. A high CTR indicates that the recipe was interesting to users and may be worth displaying again.\n\n2. Engagement rate: This measures the amount of time users spend on a recipe page after clicking on it. A high engagement rate indicates that the recipe was engaging and may be worth displaying again.\n\n3. Conversion rate: This measures the percentage of users who subscribed to the website after viewing a recipe.
